## **Summary**

<pre>
This Todo app has given me the practice in working with creating elements on the fly with Javascript.  I also learned how to remove elements on the fly as well.
Some more things I learned how to do:
    1) I leanred how to blank out the field after the user clicks the submit button.
    2) I learned how to move the checkbox from the right side to the left side.
    3) I learned howt to put the "X" in the checkbox.
    4) I learend how to change attributes with the "setAtrribute" command, as well as through CSS.
